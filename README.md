# Heart-Health-Insights-An-Exploratory-Data-Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project explores heart disease data using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and potential risk factors associated with heart disease.  
Additionally, it includes predictive analysis using **Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms** and **clustering techniques** to gain deeper insights.

## 🔍 Analysis Performed  

### 🟢 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- 📌 **Output Distribution**: Analyzed class imbalance in heart disease presence.  
- 📌 **KDE Plots**: Visualized feature distributions (e.g., age, cholesterol, heart rate) across heart disease classes.  
- 📌 **Pair Plots**: Identified feature correlations.  
- 📌 **Regression Plots**: Explored relationships between age and other key features.  
- 📌 **Count Plots**: Examined categorical feature distributions (e.g., sex, chest pain type).  
- 📌 **Correlation Heatmap**: Highlighted strong relationships between features.  

### 🟢 2. Predictive Analysis using Association Rule Mining  
- 🔹 **Apriori Algorithm**: Identified frequent itemsets and rules related to heart disease.  
- 🔹 **FP-Growth Algorithm**: Discovered additional frequent patterns with lower support thresholds.  
- 🔹 **Lift-based Heatmap**: Visualized strong associations between features.  

### 🟢 3. Clustering Analysis  
- 🔸 **K-Means Clustering**: Attempted grouping based on key health metrics but showed limited separation.  
- 🔸 **Hierarchical Clustering**: Provided more meaningful separations, revealing patterns in heart disease risk factors.  
- 🔸 **Scatter Plot Analysis**: Examined feature clusters for insights.  

### 🟢 4. Machine Learning with PySpark  
- ⚡ **Data Preprocessing**: Feature scaling, one-hot encoding, and PCA for dimensionality reduction.  
- ⚡ **Classification Models Used**:  
  - ✅ Logistic Regression  
  - ✅ Decision Tree Classifier  
  - ✅ Random Forest Classifier  
  - ✅ Naïve Bayes Classifier  
- ⚡ **Model Performance Comparison**: Evaluated accuracy and strengths of each model.
