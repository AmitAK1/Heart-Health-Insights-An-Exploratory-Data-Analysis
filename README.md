# Heart-Health-Insights-An-Exploratory-Data-Analysis
#Project Overview
This project explores heart disease data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to uncover patterns, relationships, and potential risk factors associated with heart disease. It also includes predictive analysis using Apriori and FP-Growth algorithms and clustering techniques to gain deeper insights.
#Future Work
Improve classification models using advanced hyperparameter tuning.
Experiment with ensemble learning methods for better prediction accuracy.
Apply deep learning models for further pattern recognition.
Explore additional feature engineering techniques to enhance clustering.
